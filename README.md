# Winterdesk dotfiles
## Overview
These are the dotfiles I use for my desktop system.
They include functional stuff like keybindings and program behaviour,
but also the looks and style of my system.

## Supported Programs (+dependencies)
- i3wm
- nvim (dep: junegunn/vim-plug)

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Choose configs and install locations in `install.sh`
3. Run `install.sh`

## TODO
Rethink whether symlinks are preferrable over copying the config files, modify `install.sh` accordingly.
